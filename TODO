	make flag for fast rectangle outline moving of window
	or full bitmap moving

bgi drivers
	egavga
	nvga		; x modes of vga
	mono		; mono chrome
	tandy		; tandy line of computers

	svga		; super vga (multiple)


window width & height seem to be slightly off *** done


window close should generate refresh rectangle message *** done


egavga driver should include special mode that gets set through special 
function to set width and height of mode and store mode number for this
special mode.

			algorithm
			---------

			detect extra mode - Detect routines
			say driver is egavga, mode == 8000h+mode number.
			when driver is called with -1 mode number
				use special mode #
